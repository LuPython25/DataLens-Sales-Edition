# 📊 Sales Analysis and Regression Model

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data to understand which factors influence revenue. Through data visualization and regression models, we explore patterns and insights to improve decision-making.

This is my first data analysis project, started with the help of ChatGPT. My goal is to learn as much as possible and build a solid foundation in data analysis and visualization. In future projects, I plan to deepen the skills I am developing here.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains sales-related information, including:
- **Unit Price:** Price per unit of the product  
- **Quantity:** Number of units sold  
- **Tax 5%:** Tax applied to sales  
- **Sales:** Total revenue from the sale  
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Direct cost of producing goods  
- **Gross Margin Percentage:** Profitability measure  
- **Gross Income:** Profit after expenses  
- **Rating:** Customer ratings of the products  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Strong correlations exist between sales, tax, and COGS.
- Sales volume is significantly influenced by unit price and quantity.
- Customer ratings show little impact on revenue generation.

## 🤖 Regression Model
A linear regression model was trained to predict sales based on available features. This model helps understand which factors have the most influence on revenue.

**Model Explanation:**
We trained a linear regression model to predict sales based on features such as price and quantity, allowing us to estimate future revenue. This provides insights into how changes in these variables impact total revenue.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for regression modeling  
- **Google Colab** for running the project  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LuPython25/DataLens-Sales-Edition
   cd DataLens-Sales-Edition
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.
3. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
4. Run the notebook step by step to explore the analysis and model training.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Optimize the regression model with feature engineering
- Explore additional datasets for a broader analysis
- Build interactive visualizations
